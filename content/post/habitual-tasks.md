NOTE: This is a continually-evolving blog post and probably won't ever be "finished"


## Read this blog post every morning {#read-this-blog-post-every-morning}

Helps set the focus for the day. Goes best with watching [Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g) (to remind me to be humble).


## Write something substantial everyday {#write-something-substantial-everyday}


### Why? {#why}

I want to get much better and more importantly, more comfortable with writing. I don't see any other way than: writing, A LOT.

I'm imposing on myself to write a semi-structured blog post, an unorganized brain dump, or really, anything, to make sure I continually sharpen my writing skills.

On that days that I don't write anything, there has to be a damn good excuse for not doing so. Better yet, maybe I can write down (in a global blog post or somewhere else) my excuse for not writing on that day.


### Writing as a way of caching information {#writing-as-a-way-of-caching-information}

I sometimes get confused easily. Something may make sense to me at the time, then, a day or so later, I forget about my understanding of it (and have to re-understand it).

So, I believe, writing down my thought processes and understanding of something can mitigate this. Similar to caching in software - saves computing resources, time, etc. in re-calculating something that's previously calculated.
And yes, this analogy probably breaks at some point, but I won't worry about it for now.


## Watch/read something educational and write about it {#watch-read-something-educational-and-write-about-it}

Some people out there have honed the skill to help others gain intuition by distilling, re-framing and/or visualizing complex topics. Pair this with the internet and you have the opportunity to learn efficiently, at your fingertips. For example:

-   [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)
-   [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/c/veritasium)

I'm usually short on time. I have a day job as a software engineer, consult for another company, contribute to open source and have multiple side projects on the side. So, want as I may to learn via reading papers/texts, time doesn't permit me to do so. Although, in the off-chances that I do get some time to read (maybe during commute, etc), I'll write about them too.
