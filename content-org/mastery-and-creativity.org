He was into Origami and he was obsessive.
He had attained a respectable level of mastery to the point of inventing new Origami figures; they actually looked pretty damn good.
Conversely, a person who barely knows Origami can invent a series of folds but end up generating crumpled paper instead of Origami.

Why do you have to be a master (to some extent) to (intentionally[fn:1]) invent?

* Knowing which constraints can be relaxed
TODO

* Footnotes
[fn:1] I say intentionally because flukes borne out of a stroke of luck don't count, as far as this thought exercise goes.
