I've started watching [[yt:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr][this]] amazing series by the amazing [[yt:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw][3Blue1Brown]] channel

* Ep 1
Introductory ep. for the series. Gives a taste of re-framing Calculus as not just a bunch of formulae to memorize but as a creative endeavour of understanding every step.
