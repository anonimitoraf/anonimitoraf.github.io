I've started watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) amazing series by the amazing [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) channel


## Ep 1 {#ep-1}

Introductory ep. for the series. Gives a taste of re-framing Calculus as not just a bunch of formulae to memorize but as a creative endeavour of understanding every step.
